# Simple-AZ-SpeechToText

### THIS IS A SAMPLE BASE FOR MY FUTURE PROJECTS.

## **Prerequisites**

- An Azure account and an Azure Speech to Text resource. If you don't have an Azure account, you can sign up for a free trial here: **[https://azure.microsoft.com/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)**. To create an Azure Speech to Text resource, follow the instructions here: **[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-js-browser?tabs=javascript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-js-browser?tabs=javascript)**
- The Azure Speech to Text JavaScript SDK. You can include the SDK in your HTML page by adding the following script tag:

```
<script src="https://cdn.speechly.com/speechly-sdk.js"></script>
```

# Plug. Play. Enjoy.
